Why this game?:

I chose to create this game because I love all things horror! I did not want this specific game to be too dark though. Adding a touch of humor to this game really made it come to life create a more enjoyable experience for a user. 


  Your choices:

  You can choose from Bite, Scratch, Garlic, Silver Bullet, Wooden Stake, and Crossbow. Each does a unique amount of damage and some have limited use. 
  Bite wins vs Scratch. 
  Scratch wins vs Garlic.
  Garlic wins vs Bite. 
  Each instance of you winning will steal one heart from the enemy. 
  Wooden Stake deals two damage. 
  Silver Bullet deals three damage. 
  Crossbow deals four damage.
  Each of these can only be used twice. 

  Understanding how damage is dealt:

  Damage is deal to the loser or who has dealt the lesser amount of damage. For example, if you choose Crossbow and the Computer chooses Bite, you will deal three damage since Bite only deals one damage. 
  How to win:
  Get the enemy vampire to zero hearts!


Technologies Used: HTML, Javascript, CSS.

More choices such as a health potion.

Add a start page for user to choose their character and input their personalized name in for the cpu/other player and themselves.
