Why this game?:
I chose to create this game because I love all things horror. Adding a touch of humor to this game really made it come to life create a more enjoyable experience for a user. 
Getting Started:
  Your choices:
  You can choose from Bite, Scratch, Garlic, Silver Bullet, Wooden Stake, and Crossbow. Each does a unique amount of damage and some have limited use. 
  Bite wins vs Scratch. 
  Scratch wins vs Garlic.
  Garlic wins vs Bite. 
  Each instance of you winning will steal 1 heart from the enemy. 
  Wooden Stake deals 2 damage. 
  Silver Bullet deals 3 damage. 
  Crossbow deals 4 damage.
  Each of these can only be used 2 times. 

  Understanding how damage is dealt:
  Damage is deal to the loser or who has dealt the lesser amount of damage. For example, if you choose Crossbow and the Computer chooses Bite, you will deal 3 damage since Bite only deals 1 damage. 
  How to win:
  Simply get the enemy vampire to 0 hearts!
