## Understanding the Game üéÆ
#### Available choices üí• :

Users can choose from Bite, Scratch, Garlic, Silver Bullet, Wooden Stake, and Crossbow. Each does a unique amount of damage, and some have limited use. 
- Bite wins vs Scratch. 
- Scratch wins vs Garlic.
- Garlic wins vs Bite. 

Each instance will steal one heart from the enemy if the user wins. 

- Wooden Stake deals two damage. 
- Silver Bullet deals three damage. 
- Crossbow deals four damage.

Each can only be used twice. 

### How damage is dealt ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π :

Damage is dealt to the loser, or who has dealt the lesser damage. For example, if the user selects
Crossbow and the Computer selects Bite, Vladdy Daddy will deal three damage. The outcome is this way because Bite only deals one damage versus the four by Crossbow. 

### How to win ü§© :

Get the enemy vampire to zero hearts!

## Why this game? üïπ :

I chose to create this game because I love all things horror! However, I did not want this specific game to become dark. Adding a touch of humor to this game really makes it come to life and help create a more enjoyable experience for a user.
